**Student Grade Tracker**

This Python program demonstrates the concept of a *linked list* by providing a grade tracking system for multiple students. It enables the user to manage a database of students, their courses, and their grades, using linked list operations to efficiently store and manipulate the data.

**Features**

1. Add new students and courses to the system
2. Enter grades for each course and student
3. View the grade summary for each course and student
4. Search for specific students or courses by name

**How it works**

The program uses a linked list to store and organize the data, making it easy to add, delete, and modify entries as needed. Each student is represented as a node in the list, with its own set of courses and grades. Linked list operations such as traversal, insertion, and deletion are used to manage the data.
